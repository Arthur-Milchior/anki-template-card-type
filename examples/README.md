# Examples
In this folder, you'll find a list of note types I created using this
add-on. 

More precisely, each folder correspond to a note type. They contain at
least one python file, which is the actual python code used by the
author of this add-on. They also contains a file called README.md
which explains the content of this folder. More precisely, it contains:
* the purpose of this note type,
* example of expected result
* python code to obtain this
* code of the template
* Explanation of those code.

I may use simplified code in the explanation, to concentrate on the
main point of this example. There are parts of every note types which
are identical and that I don't want to explain each time.

## List of examples

* [face](face) is the most basic example: learning people name and
  role/job/whatever other information you need to know about them.
* [this example](closed): This example show how to have plenty of
  similar notes with only a number changing. More precisely, in this
  example, I consider how to learn under which mathematical operation
  a set is closed. No mathematics are required to understand this
  example.
* [Relation](relation): this example is similar to the last one, but
  more complicated. It is used to show examples relation (being small,
  implication, equality), between two or more things.
