# Programmable Templates's introduction
This is a BETA version. If people want to help debugging and
improving. It may change a lot and while I use this add-on a lot, I
can't promise it to be fit for everyone (yet?)

## Rationale
One of anki big limitation, as far as I'm concerned, is that templates
can't have code in them. In my case, in a fixed note type, most of the
templates are similar. Which means that I have to do a lot of
copy-paste. And if I want to edit a part of the template, I have to
edit once in each template.

To learn how to use this add-on, go to https://github.com/Arthur-Milchior/anki-template-card-type/tree/master/README.md
